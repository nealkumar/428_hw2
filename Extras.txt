1) I used the whole week + 2 day extension to work on the assignment. While the majority of the assignment was completed
	by the original due date, I used the extension to work on the "delete" bonus. All-in-all, I spent about 30 hours in total.
	
2) The most difficult part of the assignment was doing the JPanel work, and that's where I spent the most time. The networking 
	part was relatively straightforward, and once functionality was verified that part was okay. My main issue with the JPanel 
	was not knowing about putting repaint() in the paintComponent() method. I originally thought I had to use an Observer/Observable
	pattern (where the panel/strategy are observers of the server). Once I realized this wasn't feasible, my next thought was to 
	somehow add a listener to the Panel.circleList (the master list holding all active circles), because how would JPanel know to 
	update with a new or removed circle? Turns out, all I needed to do was add in repaint() in paintComponent() since that's called
	multiple times a second (I believe its 60?). 
	
**Side note** as long as the first character of a client message starts with a, and there is some kind of char (non-digit) separation
between the x and y coordinates, a new Circle should be added, ex: a123i123 places a new Circle at (123, 123).
